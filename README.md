# Trading_Bot
Simplified Binance Futures Trading Bot using Python and Testnet API.

This project demonstrates a simplified cryptocurrency trading bot built using Python and the official Binance Futures Testnet API. The bot allows users to place market and limit orders on USDT-M Futures through a command-line interface. It supports both buy and sell sides and is designed with basic logging and error handling to track activity and failures.

The bot uses the python-binance library for API interaction and connects to the Binance Futures Testnet using a secure API key and secret. It accepts user input interactively, validates the data, and submits orders to the appropriate endpoint.

# Key features include:

Support for MARKET and LIMIT orders

Execution of BUY or SELL trades

Logging of all order requests, responses, and errors

Secure interaction with the Binance Futures Testnet

Easy-to-use command-line interface

Modular design using a Python class for reusability

This project serves as a foundational tool for understanding automated trading and interacting with crypto exchanges through APIs.
